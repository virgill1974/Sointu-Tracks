# Sointu Tracks

A growing collection of Sointu / 4klang compositions by Virgill. Sointu is a modern fork of the classic 4klang soft synth and ideal for ultra-small binaries (4k/8k intros, trackmos, etc.).

## Night Ride (8k Intro)

- **Title:** Night Ride
- **Origin:** Soundtrack from the 8k intro ["Night Ride" by Ctrl-Alt-Test](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=98212)
- **Style:** Synthwave with warm basslines, glassy FM chords and a minimal groove
- **Format:** Pure Sointu setup (score + patch data) – perfect for analysis, remixes or as a starting point for your own low-size synth explorations
- **Files:** `tracks/night-ride/night-ride.yaml`

## Yttrium (4k Intro)

- **Title:** Yttrium
- **Origin:** Ambient/orchestral score from the 4k intro ["Yttrium" by Alcatraz](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=104552)
- **Style:** Dark, slow-burning atmospheres with orchestral swells.
- **Format:** Complete Sointu score + patches highlighting strings, deep drones and noisy textures
- **Files:** `tracks/yttrium/yttrium.yaml`, `tracks/yttrium/yttrium.mp3`

### Rendering

1. Install the Sointu CLI or plugin (see the [Sointu GitHub repo](https://github.com/vsariola/sointu)).
2. Import the YAML into your setup or render via CLI, e.g. `sointu render night-ride.yaml -o night-ride.wav`.
3. Add your own automation/patterns and export again if needed.

*Night Ride is source-only for now; Yttrium also ships with an MP3 reference render.*
